# Autoencoding-Compression-for-Satellite-Imagery-Using-Masked-Autoencoders-
 This project is a milestone on the way of realizing of Light-weight Masked Autoencoders as a viable paradigm for  satellite image compression. By acquiring compact, semantically meaningful latent representations, the MAE model makes  the trade-off between compression ratio and reconstruction fidelity better.
